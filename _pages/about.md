I am a Ph.D. candidate in Industrial Engineering at Northeastern University, working with [<a href="https://coe.northeastern.edu/people/heydari-babak/"> Prof. Babak Heydari </a>] at [<a href="https://sites.google.com/view/magicslab/home"> Multi-AGent Intelligent Complex System (MAGICS)Lab</a>].

As a research assistant in industrial engineering, understanding the questions in the industry and then looking for a suitable tool to solve them is my daily job. Through long-term training, I have become a fast learner and solid problem solver to achieve various objectives in my academic career or previous professional experience. Over the past several years, I have gained extensive experience in handling big data and modeling. 

To look for insight into big data, I am proficient at generating different models, ranging from basic regression models to complex machine learning models. I also have the advanced knowledge to analyze the data from the network perspective, which is particularly useful for social media and spatial data. Meanwhile, developing causal models to explain the causal effect between two impact factors or two datasets is another increasing skill in my Ph.D. program
