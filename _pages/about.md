As a student in applied disciplines, I am a fast learner and  solid problem solver to satisfy various objectives in my academic career or previous working experience. To look for insight into the huge size data or data prediction, I am good at generating different models, from the simple regression model to the complex machine learning models. I also have the advanced knowledge to analyze the data from the network perspective, especially useful for spatial data. I have several years of experience to handle big data. Several of my research projects are to utilize mobility and geographic data to analyze the mobility pattern between areas. Additionally, I generated a metric system to evaluate the mobility pattern over time. Whatâ€™s interesting,  research is also related to customer behavior in the complex economic platform system. In Spring 2022, I received the 2022 Outstanding Graduate Research Award from the College of Engineering department.
