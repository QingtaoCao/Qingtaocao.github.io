The objectiveof Task 2 was to integrate mobility data into the pandemic analytics; to understand when where, how, and which mobility measures can provide the highest predictive power; to explore the role of mobility networks –as opposed to simple mobility intensity; and, to use changes in mobility measures as proxies for changes in the behavioral responses and the implication of these behavioral responses in the predictive power of mobility network parameters
