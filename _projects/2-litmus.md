title: "Litmus: Disambiguating Queries with Tuples"
excerpt: "Various oblique query specification (OQS) systems, such as query-by-example or natural language, attempt to discern a user's desired SQL query from an indirect and imprecise specification. Often, users' specifications lead to the generation of many candidate queries, and the system must determine which of the candidate queries is the user's desired one. Litmus is a system that cherry-picks tuples from the result and solicits user feedback in order to select the user's target query from a set of candidate queries."

Various oblique query specification (OQS) systems, such as query-by-example or natural language, attempt to discern a user's desired SQL query from an indirect and imprecise specification. Often, users' specifications lead to the generation of many candidate queries, and the system must determine which of the candidate queries is the user's desired one. Litmus is a system that cherry-picks tuples from the result and solicits user feedback in order to select the user's target query from a set of candidate queries.
